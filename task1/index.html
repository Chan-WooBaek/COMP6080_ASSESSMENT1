				<ul class="bodyformat">
						<li><span>Red walnuts; and</span></li>
						<li><span>Non-red walnuts</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="bodyformat">
					Walnuts really can't be oversimplified in terms of how they're eaten. It's actually very<br>

				<p class="bodyformat"> At UNSW, nuts are grown anywhere that food can also be found. In particular, food courts.</p>
